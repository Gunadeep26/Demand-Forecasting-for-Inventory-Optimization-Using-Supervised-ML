The following Project is about predicting future demand for a meal delivery company based on historical demand data and Product features.
It illustrates the implementation of various ML algorithms such as Regression, KNN, RandomForest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. Subsequently, it uses one of the above with the least MSE to predict future demand accurately.
